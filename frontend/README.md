## How to run it

You will have to run and build the frontend first.

Download the dependencies and build the front-end service:

```sh
cd /frontend
yarn
yarn run build
```

Once built, follow the [README in the server folder](../server) to run the application

NOTE - _When updating the frontend you will have to rebuild_.
